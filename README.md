This lab handbook describes the policies and workflow of Dr. Neal Hinvest's research group in the Department of Psychology at the UNiversity of Bath . It is perpetually a work-in-progress. We are constantly aiming to meet this standard and to integrate feasible steps to improve it. It is also aspirational: we might not always achieve this standard, and so we share as much of our work publicly as possible so that readers know what we actually did.

Almost all of the book is extracted, with permission, from the lab handbook of Dr Candice Morey at Cardiff University School of Psychology. A huge amount of thanks goes to Dr Morey for openly sharing the book and associated code.
